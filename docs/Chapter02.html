<h1>Chapter 02: Assumption</h1>

Let's take a look at another English-langauge proof and translate it into <pt>ProofTree</pt>.<br>

	<block>
	If I practice, I'll improve.
	If I improve, I'll succeed.
	Therefore, if I practice, I'll succeed.
	</block>

Once again, there is a lot more going on in this proof then is fully articulated above. Let's break it down.<br>

	<block>
	The following satements exist (though they are not necesarily true):
	    I will practice.
	    I will improve.
	    I will succeed.

	We will accept the following as true:
	    (1) If I practice, I'll improve.
	    (2) If I improve, I'll succeed.

	We will now prove that if I practice, I'll succeed:
	    First, assume that I will practice.
	    Then by (1), I will improve.
	    So by (2), I will succeed.

	    Therefore, if I practice, I'll succeed.
	</block>

Note that in our proof we assumed that I would practice, seemingly without justification. This is acceptable, however, because we were proving that if I practice, I will succeeed. The way to prove such a statement is to assume that I will practice, and then to use what we know to prove that I will succeed.<br>
<br>
Let's translate.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	The following satements exist (though they are
	not necesarily true):
	    I will practice.
	    I will improve.
	    I will succeed.
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>



	<id>opaque predicate</id> P
	<id>opaque predicate</id> I
	<id>opaque predicate</id> S
	</cl>
	</row>

This looks just like last chapter.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	We will accept the following as true:
	    (1) If I practice, I'll improve.
	    (2) If I improve, I'll succeed.
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>


	<id>axiom</id> practice_improve <sp>:</sp> P <op>-></op> I
	<id>axiom</id> improve_succeed <sp>:</sp> I <op>-></op> S
	</cl>
	</row>

Once again, just like last chapter.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	We will now prove that if I practice, I'll succeed:
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>

	<id>theorem</id> practice_succeed <sp>:</sp> P <op>-></op> S {
	</cl>
	</row>

You don't have to name your <id>theorems</id> (we didn't last chapter), but it is good practice to do so. The name of a <id>theorem</id>, like that of an <id>axiom</id>, goes right before the colon.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	    First, assume that I will practice.
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>

	    P <sp>|</sp> <ju>assumption</ju>
	</cl>
	</row>

While we don't necessarily know if <cd>P</cd> is true, we still can assume that it is because we are trying to prove that it implies something else. Rather than cite an <id>axiom</id> to justify <cd>P</cd> (because again, it might not even be true), we instead use the <ju>assumption</ju> justification, which is made to help prove implications such as this one.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	    Then by (1), I will improve.
	    So by (2), I will succeed.
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>

	    I <sp>|</sp> practice_improve
	    S <sp>|</sp> improve_succeed
	</cl>
	</row>

These two lines look just like the lines in last chapter's proof -- a new assertion, and the <id>axiom</id> to justify it. Note <cd>I</cd> and <cd>S</cd> are not necessarily true in a vaccume, but they are true conditional on <cd>P</cd> being true, which is good enough for this proof.<br>

	<row>
	<cl>
	<pt>English</pt>

	    Therefore, if I practice, I'll succeed.
	</cl>
	<cl>
	<pt>ProofTree</pt>

	}
	</cl>
	</row>

<pt>ProofTree</pt> automatically identifies that we have written a valid proof of <cd>P <op>-></op> S</cd>, and so we can just conclude our proof with a closing curly brace.<br>
<br>
Putting it all together:<br>

	<block>
	<id>opaque predicate</id> P
	<id>opaque predicate</id> I
	<id>opaque predicate</id> S

	<id>axiom</id> practice_improve <sp>:</sp> P <op>-></op> I
	<id>axiom</id> improve_succeed <sp>:</sp> I <op>-></op> S

	<id>theorem</id> practice_succeed <sp>:</sp> P <op>-></op> S {
	    P <sp>|</sp> <ju>assumption</ju>
	    I <sp>|</sp> practice_improve
	    S <sp>|</sp> improve_succeed
	}
	</block>
